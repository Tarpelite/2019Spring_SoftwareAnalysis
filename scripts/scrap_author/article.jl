In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES ('Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS') which allows models to be specified graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：537"}, "url": "http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v6/winn05a.html", "title": "Variational message passing"}

One of the key tasks in the application of mixture models is the determination of a suitable number of components. Conventional approaches based on cross-validation are computationally expensive, are wasteful of data, and give noisy estimates for the optimal number of components. A fully Bayesian treatment, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for instance, will return a posterior distribution over the number of components. However, in practical applications it is generally convenient, or even computationally essential, to select a single, most appropriate model. Recently it has been shown, in the context of linear latent variable models, that the use of hierarchical priors governed by continuous hyper-parameters whose values are set by type-II maximum likelihood, can be used to optimize model complexity. In this paper we extend this framework to mixture distributions by considering the classical task of density estimation using mixtures of Gaussians. We show that, by setting the mixing coefficients to maximize the marginal log-likelihood, unwanted components can be suppressed, and the appropriate number of components for the mixture can be determined in a single training run without recourse to crossvalidation.

For classi cations problems, with a suitably chosen target coding scheme, these averages represent the posterior probabilities of class membership, and so can be regarded as optimal. For problems involving the prediction of continuous variables, however, the conditional averages provide only a very limited description of the properties of the target variables. This is particularly true for problems in which the mapping to be learned is multi-valued, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems, since the average of several correct target values is not necessarily itself a correct value. In order to obtain a complete description of the data, for the purposes of predicting the outputs corresponding to new input vectors, we must model the conditional probability distribution of the target data, again conditioned on the input vector. In this paper we introduce a new class of network models obtained by combining a conventional neural network with a mixture density model. The complete system is called a Mixture Density Network, and can in principle represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions in the same way that a conventional neural network can represent arbitrary functions.

DPPs are parameterized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. While DPPs have substantial expressive power, they are fundamentally limited by the parameterization of the kernel matrix and their inability to capture nonlinear interactions between items within sets. We present the deep DPP model as way to address these limitations, by using a deep feed-forward neural network to learn the kernel matrix. In addition to allowing us to capture nonlinear item interactions, the deep DPP also allows easy incorporation of item metadata into DPP learning.

This mechanism, usually referred to as quantum cutting, is here investigated in order to develop luminescent solar converters able to transform the visible and UV solar photons into several photons with energy around 1µm. The rare-earth couple Pr3+-Yb3+ presents a level structure particularly suitable for the quantum cutting mechanism since, upon absorption of a visible photon by Pr3+ (donor), two resonant energy transfers can take place through neighboring Yb3+ ions (acceptors). The efficiency of the Pr3+→Yb3+ energy transfers is here investigated within the host materials KY3F10 and CaF2. The study of the energy transfers in KY3F10 reveals a high transfer rate but also, a remarkable quenching of the Yb3+ emission. On the other hand, the investigation of the Pr3+→Yb3+ energy transfers using CaF2 as host material is particularly interesting because of the formation of rare-earth aggregates. The short distance between the dopants forming the clusters favors the apparition of extremely efficient energy transfers in this material. The quantum cutting process is finally studied with the rare-earths Tb3+ and Yb3+ in CaF2. In this case, the simultaneous excitation of two Yb3+ ions takes place through a single cooperative energy transfer from Tb3+ ions. The cooperative mechanism is known to be less efficient than resonant energy transfers , nevertheless, the rare-earth clustering in CaF2 codoped Tb3+-Yb3+ gives rise to energy transfer efficiencies notably higher than that …", "引用总数": "被引用次数：1"}, "url": "https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01092812/", "title": "Quantum Cutting Processes in Rare-earth doped fluorides for Photovoltaic applications"}

We propose to smooth the structured penalty, since this approach allows a generic framework in which a large range of nonsmooth convex structured penalties can be minimized without computing their proximal operators. This is beneficial since the proximal operators are either not known or expensive to compute. The problem can be minimized with an accelerated proximal gradient method, taking advantage of the potential (non-smoothed) sparsity-inducing penalties.

The estimated deformation fields are then applied to the subject's EPI scans (functional or diffusion-weighted images) to warp the latter to a template space. Historically, such indirect T1w-based registration was motivated by the lack of clear anatomical details in low-resolution EPI images: a direct registration of the EPI scans to template space would be futile. A central prerequisite in such indirect methods is that the anatomical (aka the T1w) image of each subject is well aligned with their EPI images via rigid coregistration. We provide experimental evidence that things have changed: nowadays, there is a decent amount of anatomical contrast in high-resolution EPI data. That notwithstanding, EPI distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities cannot be fully corrected. Residual uncorrected distortions induce non-rigid deformations between the EPI scans and the same subject's anatomical scan. In this manuscript, we contribute a computationally cheap pipeline that leverages the high spatial resolution of modern EPI scans for direct inter-subject matching. Our pipeline is direct and does not rely on the T1w scan to estimate the inter-subject deformation.

However, a physician will not rely on predictions by black-box models: understanding the anatomical or functional features that underpin decision is critical. Generally, the weight vectors of clas-sifiers are not easily amenable to such an examination: Often there is no apparent structure. Indeed, this is not only a prediction task, but also an inverse problem that calls for adequate regularization. We address this challenge by introducing a convex region-selecting penalty. Our penalty combines total-variation regularization, enforcing spatial conti-guity, and 1 regularization, enforcing sparsity, into one group: Voxels are either active with non-zero spatial derivative or zero with inactive spatial derivative. This leads to segmenting contiguous spatial regions (inside which the signal can vary freely) against a background of zeros. Such segmentation of medical images in a target-informed manner is an important analysis tool. On several prediction problems from brain MRI, the penalty shows good segmentation.

We show that the sequences generated by our algorithm almost surely converge to a saddle point of the problem at stake, for a wider range of parameter values than previous methods. In particular, the condition on the step sizes depends on the coordinatewise Lipschitz constant of the differentiable function's gradient, which is a major feature allowing classical coordinate descent to perform so well when it is applicable.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is becoming an increasingly important tool for analyzing large data sets. In essence, ICA separates an observed set of signal mixtures into a set of statistically independent component signals, or source signals. In so doing, this powerful method can extract the relatively small amount of useful information typically found in large data sets. The applications for ICA range from speech processing, brain imaging, and electrical brain signals to telecommunications and stock predictions. In Independent Component Analysis, Jim Stone presents the essentials of ICA and related techniques (projection pursuit and complexity pursuit) in a tutorial style, using intuitive examples described in simple geometric terms. The treatment fills the need for a basic primer on ICA that can be used by readers of varying levels of mathematical sophistication, including engineers, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists who need to know the essentials of this evolving method. An overview establishes the strategy implicit in ICA in terms of its essentially physical underpinnings and describes how ICA is based on the key observations that different physical processes generate outputs that are statistically independent of each other.

Previous work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function. However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization. In this paper we show that for the purposes of network training, the regularization term can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers.

Recently, they were shown to fluctuate across brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task [26]: Notably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases during task in activating and deactivating brain regions. Such results were obtained using tools assuming Gaussianity and self-similar models, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those two assumptions [16] and were often based on voxelwise or regionwise independent analysis, hence showing large inter-subject variability. The present article aims at contributing to the analysis of scale-free properties of fMRI signals in two respects. First, a recent statistical analysis tool, the Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF), is used [45,3]. It shows improved estimation performance, and it is framed within a richer and more versatile class of models, that of multifractal processes. Second, scale-free properties are not investigated at the voxel or region scale. Instead, resting-state brain networks are extracted using a Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm [40]: It produces both a set of spatial components, and a set of times series, for each component and each subject, that conveys ongoing dynamics in functional networks but also in artifacts. These combined tools are applied to an fMRI dataset comprising 12-subjects with resting-state and activation runs [36].

While predefined brain atlases do not adapt to the signal in the individual subjects images, parcellation approaches use brain activity (e.g. found in some functional contrasts of interest) and clustering techniques to define regions with some degree of signal homogeneity. In this work, we address the question of which clustering technique is appropriate and how to optimize the corresponding model. We use two principled criteria: goodness of fit (accuracy), and reproducibility of the parcellation across bootstrap samples. We study these criteria on both simulated and two task-based functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets for the Ward, spectral and K-means clustering algorithms. We show that in general Ward’s clustering performs better than alternative methods with regards to reproducibility and accuracy and that the two criteria diverge regarding the preferred models (reproducibility leading to more conservative solutions), thus deferring the practical decision to a higher level alternative, namely the choice of a trade-off between accuracy and stability.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：202"}, "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2014.00167", "title": "Which fMRI clustering gives good brain parcellations?"}

An important view of modern neuroscience is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reflects modularity properties of brain connectivity graphs. However, to date, there has been no demonstration that the limited and noisy data available in spontaneous activity observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic models that generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i) modeling full brain connectivity is a difficult estimation problem that faces the curse of dimensionality and ii) variability between subjects, coupled with the variability of functional signals between experimental runs, makes the use of multiple datasets challenging. We describe subject-level brain functional connectivity structure as a multivariate Gaussian process and introduce a new strategy to estimate it from group data, by imposing a common structure on the graphical model in the population. We show that individual models learned from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using this population prior generalize better to unseen data than models based on alternative regularization schemes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cross-validated model of spontaneous brain activity. Finally, we use the estimated graphical model to explore the large-scale characteristics of functional architecture and show for the first time that known cognitive networks appear as the integrated communities of functional connectivity graph.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：200"}, "url": "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4080-brain-covariance-selection-better-individual-functional-connectivity-models-using-population-prior", "title": "Brain covariance selection: better individual functional connectivity models using population prior"}

Independent components analysis is the reference approach to estimate spatial components from weakly structured data such as brain signal time courses; each of these components may be referred to as a brain network and the whole set of components can be conceptualized as a brain functional atlas. Recently, new methods using a sparsity prior have emerged to deal with low signal-to-noise ratio data. However, even when using sophisticated priors, the results may not be very sparse and most often do not separate the spatial components into brain regions. This work presents post-processing techniques that automatically sparsify brain maps and separate regions properly using geometric operations, and compares these techniques according to faithfulness to data and stability metrics. In particular, among threshold-based approaches, hysteresis thresholding and random walker segmentation, the latter improves significantly the stability of both dense and sparse models.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：5"}, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3925", "title": "Region segmentation for sparse decompositions: better brain parcellations from rest fMRI"}

Because of the circumstantial support for these hypotheses and the differences and contradictions between them, there is a need for carefully designed experiments that directly examine auditory-motor integration during speech production in PWS. In the current study, we used real-time manipulation of auditory feedback to directly investigate whether the speech motor system of PWS utilizes auditory feedback abnormally during articulation and to characterize potential deficits of this auditory-motor integration. Twenty-one PWS and 18 fluent control participants were recruited. Using a short-latency formant-perturbation system, we examined participants’ compensatory responses to unanticipated perturbation of auditory feedback of the first formant frequency during the production of the monophthong [ε]. The PWS showed compensatory responses that were qualitatively similar to the controls’ and had close-to-normal latencies (∼150 ms), but the magnitudes of their responses were substantially and significantly smaller than those of the control participants (by 47% on average, p<0.05).

We have recently developed Mindboggle as a fully automated, feature-matching approach to assign anatomical labels to cortical structures and activity in human brain MRI data. Label assignment is based on structural correspondences between labeled atlases and unlabeled image data, where an atlas consists of a set of labels manually assigned to a single brain image. In the present work, we study the influence of using variable numbers of individual atlases to nonlinearly label human brain image data. Each brain image voxel of each of 20 human subjects is assigned a label by each of the remaining 19 atlases using Mindboggle. The most common label is selected and is given a confidence rating based on the number of atlases that assigned that label. The automatically assigned labels for each subject brain are compared with the manual labels for that subject (its atlas). Unlike recent approaches that transform subject data to a labeled, probabilistic atlas space (constructed from a database of atlases), Mindboggle labels a subject by each atlas in a database independently. When Mindboggle labels a human subject's brain image with at least four atlases, the resulting label agreement with coregistered manual labels is significantly higher than when only a single atlas is used.

Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed.

However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: 1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; 2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; 3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; 4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and 5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages.

First of all, we check that a simulated thalamic profile based on 200 well-chosen genes can transfer signal from cerebellar Purkinje cells to the thalamus. This inspires us to sub-sample the atlas of genes by repeatedly drawing random sets of 200 genes and refitting the model.

That is, our auditory perceptual spaces are warped representations of acoustic space. One example of auditory space warping, the perceptual magnet effect, arises from exposure to the phonemes of an infant’s native language. We have developed a neural model that accounts for this effect. The model is based on the idea that category learning during infancy changes the distribution of the firing preferences of neurons in auditory cortical maps and thus changes the discriminability of sounds from different parts of acoustic space. The model predicts that it should be possible to induce a perceptual magnet effect for non-speech stimuli. This prediction was verified by a psychophysical experiment in which subjects underwent categorization training involving non-speech auditory stimuli that were not “categorical” prior to training. The model further predicts that the magnet effect arises because prototypical vowels have smaller auditory cortical representations than non-prototypical vowels. This prediction was supported by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment involving prototypical and non-prototypical examples of the vowel/i/. The model thus provides an account of phoneme category learning that unifies observations from auditory psychophysics, cortical neurophysiology, and neural modeling.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：35"}, "url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ast/23/4/23_4_213/_article/-char/ja/", "title": "Learning sound categories: A neural model and supporting experiments"}

Currently, however, no widely accepted standards exist for partitioning the cortex and subcortical structures, or for assigning labels to the resulting regions, and many procedures are being actively used. Previous attempts to reconcile neuroanatomical nomenclatures have been largely qualitative, focusing on the development of thesauri or simple semantic mappings between terms. Here we take a fundamentally different approach, discounting the names of regions and instead comparing their definitions as spatial entities in an effort to provide more precise quantitative mappings between anatomical entities as defined by different atlases. We develop an analytical framework for studying this brain atlas concordance problem, and apply these methods in a comparison of eight diverse labeling methods used by the neuroimaging community. These analyses result in conditional probabilities that enable mapping between regions across atlases, which also form the input to graph-based methods for extracting higher-order relationships between sets of regions and to procedures for assessing the global similarity between different parcellations of the same brain. At a global scale, the overall results demonstrate a considerable lack of concordance between available parcellation schemes, falling within chance levels for some atlas pairs.

An important view of modern neuroscience is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reflects modularity properties of brain connectivity graphs. However, to date, there has been no demonstration that the limited and noisy data available in spontaneous activity observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic models that generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i) modeling full brain connectivity is a difficult estimation problem that faces the curse of dimensionality and ii) variability between subjects, coupled with the variability of functional signals between experimental runs, makes the use of multiple datasets challenging. We describe subject-level brain functional connectivity structure as a multivariate Gaussian process and introduce a new strategy to estimate it from group data, by imposing a common structure on the graphical model in the population. We show that individual models learned from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using this population prior generalize better to unseen data than models based on alternative regularization schemes.

However, few studies have systematically identified co-expressed genes involved in the molecular origin and development of various types of tumors. In this study, we used a network mining algorithm to identify tightly connected gene co-expression networks that are frequently present in microarray datasets from 33 types of cancer which were derived from 16 organs/tissues. We compared the results with networks found in multiple normal tissue types and discovered 18 tightly connected frequent networks in cancers, with highly enriched functions on cancer-related activities. Most networks identified also formed physically interacting networks. In contrast, only 6 networks were found in normal tissues, which were highly enriched for housekeeping functions. The largest cancer network contained many genes with genome stability maintenance functions. We tested 13 selected genes from this network for their involvement in genome maintenance using two cell-based assays. Among them, 10 were shown to be involved in either homology-directed DNA repair or centrosome duplication control including the well- known cancer marker MKI67. Our results suggest that the commonly recognized characteristics of cancers are supported by highly coordinated transcriptomic activities.

Due to the poor annotation of primary microRNA (pri-microRNA) transcripts, the precise location of promoter regions driving expression of many microRNA genes is enigmatic. This deficiency hinders our understanding of microRNA-mediated regulatory networks. In this study, we develop a computational approach to identify the promoter region and transcription start site (TSS) of pri-microRNAs actively transcribed using genome-wide RNA Polymerase II (RPol II) binding patterns derived from ChIP-seq data. Based upon the assumption that the distribution of RPol II binding patterns around the TSS of microRNA and protein coding genes are similar, we designed a statistical model to mimic RPol II binding patterns around the TSS of highly expressed, well-annotated promoter regions of protein coding genes. We used this model to systematically scan the regions upstream of all intergenic microRNAs for RPol II binding patterns similar to those of TSS from protein coding genes. We validated our findings by examining the conservation, CpG content, and activating histone marks in the identified promoter regions. We applied our model to assess changes in microRNA transcription in steroid hormone-treated breast cancer cells. The results demonstrate many microRNA genes have lost hormone-dependent regulation in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells.

We present a theorem that explains, for broad classes of affinity matrices and eigenbases, why this works: For successively smaller eigenbases (ie, using fewer and fewer of the affinity matrixs dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors), the angles between similar vectors in the new representation shrink while the angles between dissimilar vectors grow. Specifically, the sum of the squared cosines of the angles is strictly increasing as the dimensionality of the representation decreases. Thus spectral methods work because the truncated eigenbasis amplifies structure in the data so that any heuristic postprocessing is more likely to succeed. We use this result to construct a nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) algorithm for data sampled from manifolds whose intrinsic coordinate system has linear and cyclic axes, and a novel clustering-by-projections algorithm that requires no postprocessing and gives superior performance on challenge problems from the recent literature.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：158"}, "url": "http://www.merl.com/reports/docs/TR2002-42.pdf", "title": "A unifying theorem for spectral embedding and clustering."}

An imbalanced dataset has the consequence that, when testing a system with an evaluation measure conceived for balanced datasets, a trivial system assigning all items to a single class (typically, the majority class) may even outperform genuinely engineered systems. Moreover, if this evaluation measure is used for parameter optimization, a parameter choice may result that makes the system behave very much like a trivial system. In order to avoid this, evaluation measures that can handle imbalance must be used. We propose a simple way to turn standard measures for OR into ones …", "引用总数": "被引用次数：132"}, "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5364825/", "title": "Evaluation Measures for Ordinal Regression"}

Until the late’80s, the dominant approach to the problem involved knowledge-engineering automatic categorisers, ie manually building a set of rules encoding expert knowledge on how to classify documents. In the’90s, with the booming production and availability of on-line documents, automated text categorisation has witnessed an increased and renewed interest. A newer paradigm based on machine learning has superseded the previous approach. Within this paradigm, a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by “learning”, from a set of previously classified documents, the characteristics of one or more categories; the advantages are a very good effectiveness, a considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and domain independence. In this tutorial we look at the main approaches that have been taken towards automatic text categorisation within the general machine learning paradigm.

In order to aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent research has tried to automatically determine the “PN-polarity” of subjective terms, ie identify whether a term that is a marker of opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. Research on determining whether a term is indeed a marker of opinionated content (a subjective term) or not (an objective term) has been, instead, much more scarce. In this work we describe SENTIWORDNET, a lexical resource in which each WORDNET synset s is associated to three numerical scores Obj (s), P os (s) and Neg (s), describing how objective, positive, and negative the terms contained in the synset are. The method used to develop SENTIWORDNET is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses associated to synsets, and on the use of the resulting vectorial term representations for semi-supervised synset classification.

Using point process theory for spatial statistics, we show that scanpaths contain, however, important statistical structure, such as spatial clustering on top of distributions of gaze positions. Here, we develop a dynamical model of saccadic selection that accurately predicts the distribution of gaze positions as well as spatial clustering along individual scanpaths.

Often, sensitivity is derived from estimates of the psychometric function. This function relates response probability to stimulus intensity. In estimating these response probabilities, most studies assume stationary observers: Responses are expected to be dependent only on the intensity of a presented stimulus and not on other factors such as stimulus sequence, duration of the experiment, or the responses on previous trials. Unfortunately, a number of factors such as learning, fatigue, or fluctuations in attention and motivation will typically result in violations of this assumption. The severity of these violations is yet unknown. We use Monte Carlo simulations to show that violations of these assumptions can result in underestimation of confidence intervals for parameters of the psychometric function. Even worse, collecting more trials does not eliminate this misestimation of confidence intervals.

Fize, and C. Marlot (1996) showed how rapidly observers can detect animals in images of natural scenes, but it is still unclear which image features support this rapid detection. AB Torralba and A. Oliva (2003) suggested that a simple image statistic based on the power spectrum allows the absence or presence of objects in natural scenes to be predicted. We tested whether human observers make use of power spectral differences between image categories when detecting animals in natural scenes. In Experiments 1 and 2 we found performance to be essentially independent of the power spectrum. Computational analysis revealed that the ease of classification correlates with the proposed spectral cue without being caused by it. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that in commercial stock photo databases a majority of animal images are pre-segmented from the background by the photographers and this pre-segmentation causes the power spectral differences between image categories and may, furthermore, help rapid animal detection. Data from a third experiment are consistent with this hypothesis. Together, our results make it exceedingly unlikely that human observers make use of power spectral differences between animal-and no-animal images during rapid animal detection. In addition, our results point to potential confounds in the commercially available “natural image” databases whose statistics may be less natural than commonly presumed.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：89"}, "url": "https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121340", "title": "Animal detection in natural scenes: critical features revisited"}

He found that the temporal two-interval forced-choice method (2-IFC) combined with feedback, blocked constant stimulus presentation with few different stimulus intensities, and highly trained observers resulted in the “best” threshold estimates. This recommendation is in current practice in many psychophysical laboratories and has entered the psychophysicists'“folk wisdom” of how to run proper psychophysical experiments. However, Blackwell's recommendations explicitly require experienced observers, whereas many psychophysical studies, particularly with children or within a clinical setting, are performed with naïve observers. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we find a striking and consistent discrepancy between naïve observers' behavior and that reported for experienced observers by Blackwell: Naïve observers show the “best” threshold estimates for the spatial four-alternative forced-choice method (4-AFC) and the worst for the commonly employed temporal 2-IFC. We repeated our study with a highly experienced psychophysical observer, and he replicated Blackwell's findings exactly, thus suggesting that it is indeed the difference in psychophysical experience that causes the discrepancy between our findings and those of Blackwell. In addition, we explore the efficiency of different methods and show 4-AFC to be more than 3.5 times more efficient than 2-IFC under realistic conditions.

These samples are used to estimate Bayesian confidence intervals and other characteristics of the posterior distribution. In addition, we discuss the parameterization of psychometric functions and the role of prior distributions in the analysis.

Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear filters, eg, Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians filters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end filters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justified. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the field that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble findings from several previous studies. In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive fields in the early human visual system.", "引用总数": "被引用次数：241"}, "url": "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3122-a-nonparametric-approach-to-bottom-up-visual-saliency.pdf", "title": "A nonparametric approach to bottom-up visual saliency"}

Recent studies suggest that state-of-the-art convolutional ‘deep’ neural networks (DNNs) capture important aspects of human object perception. We hypothesized that these successes might be partially related to a human-like representation of object shape. Here we demonstrate that sensitivity for shape features, characteristic to human and primate vision, emerges in DNNs when trained for generic object recognition from natural photographs. We show that these models explain human shape judgments for several benchmark behavioral and neural stimulus sets on which earlier models mostly failed. In particular, although never explicitly trained for such stimuli, DNNs develop acute sensitivity to minute variations in shape and to non-accidental properties that have long been implicated to form the basis for object recognition. Even more strikingly, when tested with a challenging stimulus set in which shape and category membership are dissociated, the most complex model architectures capture human shape sensitivity as well as some aspects of the category structure that emerges from human judgments.
